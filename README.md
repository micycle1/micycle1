I like creative coding and have taken a fancy to producing tooling for it.

These are libraries & tools I've made for Processing:

| Library  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [PeasyGradients](https://github.com/micycle1/PeasyGradients)ðŸš§ | Render 11 types of 2D gradient spectrums in 14 color spaces |
| [PThreading](https://github.com/micycle1/PThreading)  | A framework for multithreaded drawing in Processing  |
| [PText](https://github.com/micycle1/PText)ðŸš§  | Vector-based geometric text manipulation |
| [processing-skia](https://github.com/micycle1/processing-skia)  | Eases *Skija* (Skia for Java) interoperability with Processing |
| [ScrollMonitor](https://github.com/micycle1/ScrollMonitor)ðŸš§  | Aesthetic horizontally-scrolling line graph GUI element |
| [Processing Topology Suite](https://github.com/micycle1/PTS)ðŸš§  | All things computational geometry |
| [Spliner](https://github.com/micycle1/Spliner)ðŸš§  | Piecewise best-fit curves for Processing  |
